## ðŸ“Œ 2. Wine Quality Prediction
`Wine-Quality.ipynb`

### ðŸ§¾ Description:
Used machine learning models to predict wine quality based on chemical attributes such as acidity, alcohol content, and pH.

### âœ… Key Highlights:
- Preprocessed wine data for classification
- Built three models: Random Forest, SGD, and SVC
- Visualized correlation heatmaps and feature importance
- Compared model performance

### ðŸ“Š Skills Practiced:
- Classification modeling
- Data analysis and visualization
- Model comparison and evaluation
